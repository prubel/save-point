save-point is a set of (x)emacs functions that allow you to 
save your current position, buffer and place in that buffer, and
then later return to that location. Locations are stored last-in first-out
so that if you're working on some code and say, need to modify a function
in another location before finishing your current task, you can push 
your current location, navigate to the new location, and then return 
to your first location with a single command. Sometimes one problem leads
to another so save-point allows you to have arbitrarily many locations saved.


To use the mode put save-point.el in your load-path, and then, in your .emacs 
(or other initialization file) do a 
(require 'save-point)

By default it will bind: 
  save-point to C-v
  restore-point to M-v
  swap the top two locations to M-V
  clear all saved points to M-C-v

See the bottom of the file to do your own mappings. Enjoy!
